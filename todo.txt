csv.js use saveChr() in all the functions rather than doing it directly as in newRowCellChr() and others

csv.js array rslt has an empty first column - fix it!

need to find a way to test csv.js on all cases

starting to rewrite using cell, row, and table rather than
table[row],[cell]

all data is now being stored as character - need to include numbers!

	<header>Rules for the CSV file</header>
	<ul>
		<li>The delimiter between cells must be a single character</li>
		<li>If a cell starts with an odd number of quotes
			it will be a "quoted cell" and must close the quotes to end the cell 
		</li>
		<li>Quotes can be included in a quoted cell - 2 consecutive quotes
			are included in the cell contents as a single quote.</li>
		<li>a quote may appear within a unquoted cell and will be treated
			as a normal character</li>
		
		<li>New line will create a new row - unless it occurs with a
			cell in quotes - it will then be included as a character
			in that cell</li>
		<li>Delimiters may be included within quoted cells</li>
	</ul>

<header>Graphic of CSV Finite States</header>
<p>The states are in circles. The edges point to the next state based
on the character type in the CSV file. The edges are labeled with
character type and the functions that are executed.</p>

	<header>Table of Events and States</header>
	<p>This table shows the 2 dimensional array of events and states used
	by the code that implements the logic shown in the graph.

	<p>The program output is a 2 dimensional array with rows containing cells.
	Characters are gathered into a string. Completed strings are saved to
	cells by function saveChr, completed cells are saved to rows by
	function saveCell, and completed rows are saved to the table by
	function saveRow.</p>
	<p>The states are NEWCELL (an empty cell), INCELL (a string is
	collecting data for a cell), INQCELL (a string is collecting were
	the first character was a quotation mark), and QQCELL (a quote has been
	encountered with after a quotation began)</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>The program begins in the newCell State.</p>
	<p>The CSV file is processed one character at a time. Each character
		is classified according to the “Events” column of the table.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The event and state are indicate the row and column of the
			relevant cell table</li>
		<li><ul>
			<li>the function(s) in that cell is called</li>
			<li>the state is changed to the state in that cell</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>The program completes when the entire file has been processed.</li>
	</ul>

		<li>The delimiter between cells must be a single character</li>
		<li>If a cell starts with an odd number of quotes
			it will be a "quoted cell" and must close the quotes to end the cell 
		</li>
		<li>Quotes can be included in a quoted cell - 2 consecutive quotes
			are included in the cell contents as a single quote.</li>
		<li>a quote may appear within a unquoted cell and will be treated
			as a normal character</li>
		
		<li>New line will create a new row - unless it occurs with a
			cell in quotes - it will then be included as a character
			in that cell</li>
		<li>Delimiters may be included within quoted cells</li>

<p>The states are in circles. The edges point to the next state based
on the character type in the CSV file. The edges are labeled with
character type and the functions that are executed.</p>

	<p>This table shows the 2 dimensional array of events and states used
	by the code that implements the logic shown in the graph.

	<p>The program output is a 2 dimensional array with rows containing cells.
	Characters are gathered into a string. Completed strings are saved to
	cells by function saveChr, completed cells are saved to rows by
	function saveCell, and completed rows are saved to the table by
	function saveRow.</p>
	<p>The states are NEWCELL (an empty cell), INCELL (a string is
	collecting data for a cell), INQCELL (a string is collecting were
	the first character was a quotation mark), and QQCELL (a quote has been
	encountered with after a quotation began)</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>The program begins in the newCell State.</p>
	<p>The CSV file is processed one character at a time. Each character
		is classified according to the “Events” column of the table.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The event and state are indicate the row and column of the
			relevant cell table</li>
		<li><ul>
			<li>the function(s) in that cell is called</li>
			<li>the state is changed to the state in that cell</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>The program completes when the entire file has been processed.</li>
	</ul>

<ul>

I would like to write a function to read the file(s) that does not need
to know the name of the html element from which it was called like

     document.getElementById("openFile").addEventListener('change',
	 function() {// an anonymous function I need to rewrite any time
	              i want to use it!}
	</p></li>

	<li>As of November 2018 the Chrome broswer cannot load local js
	modules. That's why I wrote the Csv class in CLsv.js which has no
	side effects and creates no golobal variables
	</li>
	<li>Frustratingly  I don't understand: when the CLsv.js executes a function 
		rule[0](this);		// execute the appropriate function
		The function which one of the csv class functions no longer
		shares scope with it's parent!  Therefor I had to pass the 
		Csv.this as a parameter to it's own funtions.
	</li>
</ul>
